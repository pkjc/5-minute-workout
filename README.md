-Workout anywhere, anytime, no equipment needed
-To get a new set of random exercises refresh the app

## How it works

The 5 minute workout app is a [Progressive Web App](http://google.com) so it works offline too. Ideal way to use: open it in Google Chrome on your phone and add it to your homescreen.

The app files will get cached to your device and would work without a network connection on subsequent uses (Not tested on all devices/platforms/browsers).

The app is still in beta so expect bugs and inconsistent behavior. If you face any issues please report them using this [Google form](http://google.com).
